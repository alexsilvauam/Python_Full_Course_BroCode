#Variable = A container for storing data values. (String, Integer, Float, Boolean)
#           A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# String 
first_name = "Bro"
food = "Pizza"
email = "Bro123@fake.com"

# Integer
age = 20
quantity = 5
num_of_cars = 2

# Float
height = 5.9
weight = 150.5

# Boolean
is_student = True
is_employed = False

if is_student:
    print("You are a student.")
else:
    print("You are not a student.")
